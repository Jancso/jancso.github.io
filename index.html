                    <p>
                        I'm a second-year master's student in Informatics at the
                        <a href="https://www.uzh.ch/en.html">University of Zurich</a>.
                        I received my bachelor's degree in Computational Linguistics and
                        General Linguistics in January 2018
                        from the University of Zurich.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Besides my studies, I'm working part-time as a student (research)
                        assistant for the
                        <a href="https://www.acqdiv.uzh.ch/en.html">ACQDIV</a> and the
                        <a href="https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/seal.html">s.e.a.l.</a> group. You can find my full CV

                        As you might have guessed from my CV, I have interests in various areas.
                        When I began studying at the university, I saw my strengths in linguistics
                        because I could quickly grasp and memorize language
                        grammars. However, I also wanted to try out something more technical and therefore also chose
                        computational linguistics where I learned programming for the first time. Immediately,
                        I was intrigued that I could fully automate certain tasks that
                        I had done manually previously. Eventually, I decided to switch to CS for my master's.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Funnily enough, CS and linguistics have more in common than one would expect,
                        as also evidenced by the number of terms that CS borrowed from linguistics:
                        language, grammar, word, syntax, semantics, etc.
                        In fact, it was the famous linguist Noam Chomsky who created a hierarchy of formal languages,
                        known as the Chomsky-Hierarchy.

                        Now, I have to admit that I find studying formal languages
                        far less interesting than natural ones. Generally, theoretical informatics is not my cup of
                        tea! One the other hand, I'm very interested in the following CS areas (no particular order):
                    </p>

                    <ul class="normal-list">
                        <li>Software Engineering & Architecture</li>
                        <li>Natural Language Processing</li>
                        <li>Computational Science</li>
                        <li>Cyber Security</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Currently, I'm working in the areas of software engineering (DevOps) and
                        natural language processing (corpus building & processing). Previously, I also worked in the
                        area of bioinformatics (NER of biomedical entities). You can read all about my
                        programming projects
                        <a href="projects.html">here</a>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Even though, linguistics is not part of my curriculum anymore, (natural) languages still
                        interest me. I'm about to complete my third language course at the university: Russian. Before
                        that, I took Latin and Arabic lessons.

                        In my free time, I enjoy playing the piano. I mostly play
                        classical pieces from the Baroque, Classical and Romantic era, but have also played more
                        'contemporary' works such as Debussy's <i>Doctor Gradus ad Parnassum</i> or Joplin's
                        <i>Maple Leaf Rag</i>.
                        I especially like virtuoso and dramatic piano works from the romantic era
                        such as Chopin's <i>Étude Op. 10, No. 4</i> or Schumann's
                        <i>Piano Sonata No. 2, Mov. 1</i>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My second hobby is hiking. I especially like T3-T4 hikes in the Glarus and Grisons Alps
                        (Glarner & Büdner Alpen), e.g. <i>Vorder Glärnisch</i> or <i>Lej da la Tscheppa</i>.
                        Usually, you find me hiking in the Glarus Alps since they are
                        quite close to where I live.
                        (By the way, the picture with the mountains was taken close to the Albula Pass)
